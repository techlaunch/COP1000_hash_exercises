Practice how to use hashes in JavaScript

## 1. Create an array that stores the hash tables of these words.  Then write code that accepts a word from the user and then compares its sha1 hash to those in your array and returns a message saying whether the word was found in the array.  Sample words: 
* Dog 
* Cat 
* Wolf 
* Cheetah 
* Hippopotamus 
* Whale 
* Dolphin 
* Beaver 
* Bird 
* Gecko 

## 2. Create a variable called password.  Write a program that asks the user to create a password, and then stores its sha1 hash value in a variable.  Then after the password is saved, ask the user to enter a password and then if they entered the same password (by comparing both hash values) then it should say the password is correct, otherwise say that the password is not correct. 

## 3. Create an array that stores the hash tables of these lotto numbers.  Then write code that accepts a number from the user and then compares its sha1 hash to those in your array and returns a message saying whether the number is a lotto winner (was found in one value of the array).  Winning Numbers: 
* 65898135 
* 86886285 
* 53675283 
* 32865895 
* 75387268 
* 34586258 
* 67852357 
* 80247217 
* 56885789 
* 95347285
